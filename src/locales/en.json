    "title": "Terms and conditions",
    "intro": "These terms and conditions (T&Cs) apply to any chauffeur-driven passenger transport (VTC) booking made through Safeness Transport, whether the order is placed online, by phone or by messaging (WhatsApp, etc.). By booking, the customer accepts these T&Cs without reservation.\n\nThey define the rights and obligations of the parties in relation to chauffeur-driven transport services (airport transfers, city trips, events). In the event of conflict between these T&Cs and a quote or specific agreement, the quote or agreement shall prevail for the relevant points.",
    "scope": "Scope",
    "scopeContent": "These T&Cs govern the chauffeur-driven passenger transport (VTC) services offered by Safeness Transport: airport transfers (CDG, Orly, Le Bourget), city trips, events (weddings, corporate, trade shows), and any custom-quote service. Booking online or by phone/WhatsApp, once confirmed by Safeness Transport, constitutes conclusion of the contract and acceptance of these terms. Specific terms (quotes, agreements) may supplement the T&Cs for custom services.\n\nThe customer undertakes to provide accurate information (locations, times, number of passengers and bags). Any misrepresentation that leads to extra cost or inability to perform the service may be charged or result in cancellation of the booking without compensation.",
    "price": "Rates and payment",
    "priceContent": "Rates are communicated before confirmation of the booking (quote, online summary or message). They may be fixed (set route) or hourly depending on the service. Payment may be made on board (cash, card), by secure payment link sent after booking, or by corporate invoice (subject to prior agreement). Prices generally include the agreed journey, tolls and standard waiting time; supplements (extra hours, night pick-up, options) are indicated at booking. Any change to the route or programme that may affect the price must be reported and may result in a price adjustment.\n\nRates shown as \"from\" are base prices; the final amount depends on locations, times and options. For corporate billing, a payment period (e.g. 30 days) may be agreed after signing an agreement. Invoices are sent by email after the service. Late payment may result in penalties and a fixed recovery-fee indemnity in accordance with the law.",
    "cancel": "Cancellation",
    "cancelContent": "Free cancellation up to 24 hours before the scheduled pick-up time. After that, cancellation fees may apply depending on the type of service (fixed rate, long distance, event). If the customer does not show up at the agreed time and place (no-show), the trip may be charged in full or in part. Any cancellation must be notified in writing (email, WhatsApp) to be taken into account.\n\nFor event services (wedding, gala, convention), specific cancellation terms may be set out in the quote (e.g. free cancellation up to 7 days before, then a percentage of the amount). If Safeness Transport cancels (force majeure, unavailability), the customer will be fully refunded. No refund will be made in case of no-show without prior notice.",
    "responsibility": "Liability",
    "responsibilityContent": "Safeness Transport is committed to punctuality, the quality of the vehicle and chauffeur, and compliance with the agreed route. In the event of delay or shortcoming attributable to our service, we do our utmost to limit any prejudice (alternative route, partial compensation as appropriate). Claims must be submitted in writing within 48 hours of the service. Our liability is limited to the amount of the trip for direct damage.\n\nThe customer is responsible for the items and luggage they carry; we recommend not leaving valuables unattended. If the customer is delayed (flight, meeting), waiting time beyond the included period may be charged. Safeness Transport disclaims liability for delay due to circumstances beyond its control (exceptional traffic, weather, force majeure), while endeavouring to inform the customer and propose solutions.",
    "disputes": "Disputes",
    "disputesContent": "In the event of a dispute, the customer may refer to consumer mediation (the relevant mediator depending on our membership). Applicable law: French law. Courts of competent jurisdiction: French courts. For any prior question, we invite you to contact us; we strive to find an amicable solution.\n\nIn accordance with the Consumer Code, the customer may use the EU online dispute resolution (ODR) platform for cross-border disputes. Acceptance of these T&Cs does not deprive the customer of the right to refer to a mediator under the conditions provided by law."
